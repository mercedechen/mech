        <p class="q">How do I request a commission from you?</p>
        <p class="a">Thank you for considering to commission me! Unfortunately at this time, commissions are closed.</p>
        <p class="q">Why are your commissions closed? When will your commissions be available again?</p>
        <p class="a">Commissions are closed due to conflicting schedules. Currently there's no tentative resumption date but hopefully this is a temporary pause.</p>
        <p class="q">Why is your showcased work at such low resolution?</p>
